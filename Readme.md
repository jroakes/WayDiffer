## Description
**Waydiffer** is a Streamlit application that compares website versions archived in the Wayback Machine. It utilizes the [diff_match_patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) library from Google for tracking differences in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files between two selected snapshots.

Features include:
- Finding available dates for a URL in the Wayback Machine.
- Cleaning code and URLs from Wayback Machine URLs.
- Diffing support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Auto-beautification of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Custom diff interface with line numbers for easy comparison.
- Two viewing options: inline or in a new window.

Note: Open in a new window does not work in Streamlit Hosted Apps.
